Today isn’t really a goodbye — it’s a quiet full stop at the end of a meaningful chapter.
This open-source journey gave me more than just commits and pull requests. It gave me perspective, confidence, late-night debugging lessons, and the feeling of being part of something bigger than myself.

Every review comment, every merged PR, every small improvement taught me how collaboration truly works — not as code, but as people building together. I’m grateful for the patience, the guidance, and the shared curiosity that made this experience so impactful.

I’m walking away with stronger skills, sharper thinking, and a deeper respect for the open-source community. This may be the end of this contribution, but it’s definitely not the end of the learning.

Thank you ABDUL for the opportunity, the trust, and the chance to grow.
Until our paths cross again — happy hacking, and keep building great things. 💙
